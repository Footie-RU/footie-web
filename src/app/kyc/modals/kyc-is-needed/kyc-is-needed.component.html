    To ensure a secure and trustworthy platform, we require all users to
    complete the KYC (Know Your Customer) process. KYC helps us verify the
    identity of users and prevents fraudulent activity, ensuring that only
    verified individuals can use our services.
  </p>
  <p>
    By submitting your KYC documents, you contribute to maintaining a safe
    environment for all users. This verification also helps us comply with
    regulatory requirements and industry standards.
  </p>
  <p>
    Please upload your selfie, international passport, and Russian passport to
    complete the verification. Once your documents are reviewed, you'll be
    notified of your approval status.
